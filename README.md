### Simpson

##### The Simpsons 1/3 function connects equally spaced points between f(a) and f(b) with a 2nd order polynomial. More specifically it solves for the integral of a function divided into three segments.


### luFactorization

##### The LU Factorization function uses partial pivoting to determine the lower and upper triangular matrices. This can then be used to find the inverse of the initial matrix.

### ModSecant

##### The Modified Secant function locates a root of a function by using the difference between the two points used. It is more accurate than the false position method.


### False Position

##### The False Position function locates a root of a function by joining f(x) and f(x1) by a straight line. Provided that f(x) is negative and f(x1) is positive.
