# Heun

### Basic Description

##### The purpose of this function is to determine the derivative of a function using the Heun method with multiple iterations. It will give a more accurate estimate than Euler's method.

### Inputs

##### dydt - This is the differential equation
##### tspan - This is the span the user wants to solve for within the equation
##### y0 - This is the initial condition
##### h - This is the step size
##### es - This is the inputted error
##### maxit - This is the inputted max interations

### Outputs

##### t - This is the outputted t value
##### y - This is the final estimated derivative of point t
