# Simpsons 1/3 Rule

### Basic Description

##### The Simpsons 1/3 function takes a matrix of data, usually broken down into an x and y group. This finds the integral of data points rather than a true function. It breaks the data points into two segments and if there is more spacing after the three segments then the trapezoidal rule is used.

### Inputs

##### x - The input of the first matrix of data the user wants to find the integral of. This is the x axis of the data given.
##### y - The input of the second matrix of data the user wants to find the integral of. This is the y axis of the data given. 

### Outputs

##### I - This is the output of the integration of the inputted matrices. Of course this is only an estimate and not be the true integration of the data. 

### Limitations

##### As stated within the output this is only an estimate of the integration for the data points. It also isn't as accurate because it splits the data into two segments.

### Other Information

##### This function sadly doesn't work quite yet. It is very close but currently it gives an estimate that is too low and doesn't integrate the trapezoidal method very well.
