### Simpson

##### The Simpsons 1/3 function takes a matrix of data, usually broken down into an x and y group. This finds the integral of data points rather than a true function. It breaks the data points into three segments and if there is more spacing after the three segments then the trapezoidal rule is used.


### luFactorization

##### The LU Factorization function uses partial pivoting to determine the lower and upper triangular matrices. This can then be used to find the inverse of the initial matrix.

### ModSecant

##### The Modified Secant function locates a root of a function by using the difference between the two points used. It is more accurate than the false position method.


### False Position

##### The False Position function locates a root of a function by joining f(x) and f(x1) by a straight line. Provided that f(x) is negative and f(x1) is positive.
