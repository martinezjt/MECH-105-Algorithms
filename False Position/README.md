# False Position

### Basic Description

##### This matrix determines the upper and lower matrix of an initial inputted square matrix. 

### Inputs

##### A square matrix of any size that you want to determine the LU Factorization of. To be a square matrix the number of rows must equal the number of columns. This is inputted as A within the LU Factorization function.

### Outputs

##### L - The Lower Triangular matrix found from the original square matrix 'A'. 
##### U - The Upper Triangular matrix found from the original square matrix 'A'. 
##### P - The Pivot Matrix. This shows how the original matrix 'A' changed based on the pivoting required within the function. It helps to keep track of all the changes that were made to the 'A' matrix. 

### Limitations

##### The major limitations of this function is that it only finds the Upper and Lower matrices of an original function. It doesn't solve for anything else with the inputted matrix. 

### Other Information

##### No other information necessary for this function
